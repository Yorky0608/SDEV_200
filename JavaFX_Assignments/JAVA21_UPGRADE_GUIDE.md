## Summary
Your JavaFX project has been successfully upgraded from Java 11 to Java 21 (the latest LTS version).

## What was changed:
1. **Java Runtime**: Upgraded from Java 11 to Java 21
2. **JavaFX Version**: Updated from 19.0.2.1 to 21.0.4 (compatible with Java 21)
3. **Maven Compiler**: Updated to compile with Java 21
4. **Project Configuration**: Updated `pom.xml` with Java 21 settings

- **Maven 3.9.9**: Apache Maven installed at `%USERPROFILE%\.maven\apache-maven-3.9.9`

## Running the Application:
To run your JavaFX application with Java 21, you have several options:

### Option 1: Use the provided scripts
- **Windows Batch**: Double-click `run-java21.bat`
- **PowerShell**: Run `.\run-java21.ps1` in PowerShell

### Option 2: Manual setup (temporary for current session)
```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE\.jdk\jdk-21.0.4+7"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:USERPROFILE\.maven\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin;$env:PATH"
mvn javafx:run
```

### Option 3: Permanent system environment variables
To make Java 21 your default Java version system-wide:

1. Open System Properties â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add/Update these system variables:
   - `JAVA_HOME` = `%USERPROFILE%\.jdk\jdk-21.0.4+7`
   - Add to `PATH`: `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` and `%USERPROFILE%\.maven\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin`

## Building the Project:
```bash
mvn clean compile  # Clean and compile
mvn package        # Build the JAR file
mvn javafx:run     # Run the JavaFX application
```

## Key Benefits of Java 21:
